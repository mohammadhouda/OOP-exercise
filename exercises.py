# Python Quiz: Guess the Output

# Question 1
print("Q1:", 7 // 3)  # Guess the output

# Question 2
print("Q2:", 7 / 2)   # Guess the output

# Question 3
print("Q3:", 3 ** 2)  # Guess the output

# Question 4
print("Q4:", len('mango') < len('avocado'))  # Guess the output

# Question 5
print("Q5:", 3 > 2 and 4 < 3)  # Guess the output

# Question 6
print("Q6:", not 3 > 2)  # Guess the output

# Question 7
text = 'Python'
print("Q7:", text[::2])  # Guess the output

# Question 8
print("Q8a:", 'A' in 'Asabeneh')  # Guess the output
print("Q8b:", 'B' in 'Asabeneh')  # Guess the output

# Question 9
mass = 75
gravity = 9.81
weight = mass * gravity
print("Q9:", weight)  # Guess the output (approximate)

# Question 10
num_one = 3
num_two = 4
total = num_one + num_two
diff = num_two - num_one
product = num_one * num_two
div = num_two / num_two
remainder = num_two % num_one
print("Q10:", total, diff, product, div, remainder)  # Guess the output

# Python String Exercises

# Exercise 1: Replace all occurrences of "a" with "A" in the string "banana"
# Expected output: 'bAnAnA'

# Exercise 2: Find the index of the first occurrence of "o" in the string "Hello, World!"
# Expected output: 4

# Exercise 3: Convert the string "   Hello, World!   " to lowercase and strip leading and trailing whitespace
# Expected output: 'hello, world!'

# Exercise 4: Calculate the final price after tax
# Formula: final_price = original_price + (original_price * tax_rate / 100)
# Given: original_price = 150, tax_rate = 12
# Expected output: 168.0

# Exercise 5: Extract "Python" from the string "I love Python programming"
# Hint: Use slicing with proper start and end indices.
# Expected output: 'Python'

# Exercise 6: Reverse the string "OpenAI" using slicing
# Hint: Use the slicing syntax with a step of -1.
# Expected output: 'IAnepO'

# I know these seem like a lot of questions but they are not that hard to solve
# Remember every programmer was once a beginner, maybe you will be lost at the start
# but with practice you will get better and better
# you can do it
# if you have any questions you can always ask me

# After you finish  all the exercises, push your code to github and share the link with me
# if you need help with git commands let me know
# here are the basic git commands you will need to push your code to github
#git commands
# git init
# git add .
# git commit -m "your commit message"
# git remote add origin your_repository_url
# git push -u origin main

# when you already have a repository (like what we did today, you have a repo already)
# access the same folder where your repo is located (the folder where you upload your code)
# put your code in that folder
# skip the git init and git remote add origin your_repository_url steps
# so you will only need to do
# git add .
# git commit -m "your commit message"
# git push

#push steps
# 1. Initialize a git repository 
# 2. Add your changes
# 3. Commit your changes
# 4. Push to your GitHub repository

# good luck
