# Python Exercises: Nested Loops and Lists

# ---
# Exercise 1: Matrix Sum
# ---
# Task: Write a function that takes a 2D list (a list of lists) of numbers
# and returns the sum of all its elements.
#
# Example:
# matrix = [
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [4, 5, 6],
#   [7, 8, 9]
# ]
# Expected Output: 45
# ---

def sum_matrix(matrix):
    # Your code here
   

    # Test the function


# ---
# Exercise 2: Find the First Duplicate
# ---
# Task: Write a function that finds the first integer that appears more than once
# in a list. Use nested loops to compare each element with every other element.
#
# Example:
# items = [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
# Expected Output: 2
# ---
 def first_duplicate(items):




# ---
# Exercise 4: Flatten a 2D List
# ---
# Task: Write a function that takes a 2D list and returns a single
# "flattened" list containing all the elements from the original nested lists.
#
# Example:
# nested_list = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e'], ['f']]
# Expected Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
# ---

  def flatten_list(nested_list):
   
    
    # Your code here
    

# Test the function



# ---
# Exercise 5: Find Common Elements
# ---
# Task: Write a function that returns a new list containing elements that are
# present in *both* list1 and list2. Do not include duplicates in the result.
#
# Example:
# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Expected Output: [4, 5]
# ---

def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    # Your code here
   

# Test the function
