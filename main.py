# Create a Python program that simulates a Car Manufacturer System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
# Your goal is to demonstrate the key OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation (using normal attributes), and methods.

# Requirements:

# Create a base class Car with:

# Attributes: brand, model, price.

# A method car_info() that returns details about the car.

# Create two subclasses that inherit from Car:

# ElectricCar → has an additional attribute battery_range.

# GasCar → has an additional attribute fuel_type.

# Both should override the car_info() method to include their own details.

# Create an instance of each subclass and display their information.
